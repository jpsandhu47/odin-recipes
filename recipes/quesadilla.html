    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Both kids and adults will appreciate this tasty twist on ground beef quesadillas. This cheeseburger quesadilla is
        both quicker and easier than an actual burger, but it's just as filling. Your family might like this mash-up
        even more than the two foods it combines. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp butter</li>
        <li>1/2 small yellow onion, chopper</li>
        <li>2lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>8 torillas</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheese</li>
        <li>4 tsp ketchup, mustard, relish</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add
            ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder; cook and stir until beef is
            browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, drain liquid from beef, and let sit for 2
            minutes.</li>

        <li>Heat griddle or flat pan over medium heat and oil</li>

        <li>Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle, top with some of the Colby cheese, 1/4 of the beef mixture, 1 teaspoon
            ketchup, 1 teaspoon mustard, and 1 teaspoon relish. Top with more Colby cheese and 1 tortilla. Flatten the
            quesadilla with your hand.</li>

        <li>Flip quesadilla with a spatula and cook until browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut
            quesadilla into 4 pieces. Repeat with remaining tortillas, ground beef, cheese, ketchup, mustard, and
            relish.</li>
    </ol>
